# Python Calculator

Hello!

My name is Vitor Feltrim, I'm from Brazil, and I'm a beginner at programming!

I developed this calculator as a way to improve to myself (and you who are seeing this!) my Python skills

Hope you enjoy my program!


NOTE:

If the .exe file don't show the colors, open your Windows PowerShell and run this script:

reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001 /f
